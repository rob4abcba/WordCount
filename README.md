# WordCount
Java program that counts the number of words per line of a specified text file.

The text file is specified in the Java code.
If the text file contains Chinese characters, then save the text file in UTF-8 format so that this Java program can handle the Chinese characters.
Unicode and Unicode Big Endian both caused the program to think the number of words is zero.
